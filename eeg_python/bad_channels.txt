p2 - good
p4 - filter+spdens check - remove bad channel
	E23 (looks reasonable after removing)
p5 - filter+spdens check - remove bad channel
	E58 (E58 at certain timestamp is definitely bad, maybe we should reject those timestamps instead of rejecting the entire channel cuz it doesn't change the log detection)
p6 - filter+spdens check - remove bad channel
	E33 (did not fix after removing, should consider removing bad segments)
p7 - good
p8 - watch video [LC]
