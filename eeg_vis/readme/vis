## Folder naming conventions:

_br vs _ch: brain regions vs main channels
	- _ch: Folders containing plots over each main channel. The main channels were chosen using the international 10-20 system, which is the method used to describe the locations of scalp electrodes for EEGs. The electrode labels (F3,O2,etc) are mapped to the electrode numbers (E12,E39,etc) using the 64-channel map provided with the EEG nets, given below:
		- FP2: "E5"
		- FCz = "E6"
		- FP1 = "E10"
		- F3 = "E12"
		- F7 = "E18"
		- C3 = "E20"
		- T7 = "E24"
		- P3 = "E28"
		- P7 = "E30"
		- Pz = "E34"
		- O1 = "E35"
		- Oz = "E37"
		- O2 = "E39"
		- P4 = "E42"
		- P8 = "E44"
		- C4 = "E50"
		- T8 = "E52"
		- F8 = "E58"
		- F4 = "E60"
	- Here, F = Frontal, C = Central, P = Parietal, T = Temporal, O = Occipital

	- _br: Folders containing plots over brain regions. These plots were generated by averaging the power over all the electrodes that correspond to that brain region. The mapping of electrodes to brain regions (R = right, L = left) is given by:
		- RFrontal = "E6", "E3", "E60", "E8", "E2", "E59", "E5", "E58", "E1"
		- LFrontal = "E6", "E9", "E12", "E8", "E11", "E13", "E10", "E18", "E17"
		- RCentral = "E4", "E54", "E51", "E41", "E53", "E50", "E57", "E49", "E46"
		- LCentral = "E4", "E7", "E16", "E21", "E15", "E20", "E14", "E22", "E26"
		- RTemporal = "E56", "E48", "E52", "E55", "E47"
		- LTemporal = "E19", "E25", "E24", "E23", "E29"
		- RParietal = "E34", "E40", "E42", "E45", "E44"
		- LParietal = "E34", "E31", "E28", "E27", "E30"
		- ROccipital = "E36", "E38", "E37", "E39", "E43"
		- LOccipital = "E36", "E33", "E37", "E35", "E32"



## How to interpret the plots:

###/general_pd and /event_pd:
	- The power spectral density gives us an idea of the frequency content of the EEG data, by giving the power at each frequency for each channel. All the channels are given on a single plot. Theoretically, lower frequencies have higher amplitudes than higher frequencies.
	- The x axis is the frequency, the y axis is the power, given in 10*log_10(power). Note that a band-pass filter was applied at 1Hz and at 50Hz, so the x limits don't go beyond that
	- Each line on the graph represents a channel; to see which channel corresponds to which colour, open the corresponding .fig file and click on the line of interest. The channel number will be printed on the matlab command line. 
	- In /power_density, the power spectral density is calculated using the signal over the full time range
	- In /event_power_density, the power spectral density is calculated using the signal within 20s after the onset of each event
	- These plots are of interest because they can indicate which channels contain more of which frequencies


###/general_tf and /event_tf:
	- The time frequency decompostion gives us a picture of how the power in each frequency band changes over time, for each channel, where each channel is plotted independently. 
	- This folder contains the time-frequency plots over each of the main channels
	- The x axis is the time, in minutes. The y axis is the frequency, with one line for each frequency between 1 and 50 Hz. 
	- In /time_frequency, the plot is given over the full time range. Note: the colour rance for these plots go from -15 to 15 dB for the ratio between the power to the baseline value, but the legend for the colour map is faulty. TODO: make legend appear.
	- In /event_time_frequency, the plot is given from 20s before the event time, until 20s after the event time. A vertical line in the center of the window indicated the event time, as labelled in the game_events section of the processed data
	- These plots are of interest because they can clue us in on event-related activations. The hope is to mimic event-related analysis using our continuous data


###/band_power:
	- This folder contains one subfolder per frequency band, to make it easy to compare the power of a single band across different electrodes and/or brain regions
	- The plots show the log power difference from baseline, as computed during the time-freqeuncy decomposition. The frequencies within the same band range were averaged together to create a single power over time plot. 
	- The x axis is the time, in minutes. The y axis is the log power difference from baseline. Each plot is of one channel or brain region, for the given frequency band.


###/alpha_theta:
	- This folder contains the plots of the difference in the alpha and theta bands for each channel or brain region over time. 
	- Each plot contains three sub-plots. The first is the Alpha band power over time, and the second is the Theta band power over time, as shown in the frequency_bands folder. the third subplot contains the difference between the alpha and theta band power, computed using log-subtraction (ie, ratio between the absolute powers). log(alpha) - log(theta).
	- The x axis is the time, in minutes. For the top two plots, the y axis is the log power difference from baseline. For the third plot, the y axis is the difference in power between the Alpha and Theta band. Each plot is of one channel or brain region
	- The "three subplots" was chosen over the "single plot of the difference" because there are different changes that can cause the same frequency response, and having all three plots makes it easier to see what the changes actually are. Eg. an increase in theta can visually look the same as a decrease in alpha 
	- Theoretically, we expect a mix of alpha suppression and theta increase during stressful moments


###/asymmetry:
	- This folder contains a subfolder for each frequency band, where each subfolder contains the plots of the difference in power between the left and right hemispheres of the brain
	- The left and right electrodes were paired up manually. 
	- Each plot contains three sub-plots. The first is the band power over time in the left side, and the second is the band power over time in the right side, as shown in the frequency_bands folder. The third subplot contains the difference between the left and right band power, computed using log-subtraction (ie, ratio between the absolute powers). log(left) - log(right)
	- The x axis is the time, in minutes. For the top two plots, The y axis is the log power difference from baseline. For the third plot, the y axis is the difference in power between the left and right hemisphere's power band. Each plot is of one channel or brain region
	- Since the plot is for left - right, a more "positive" value in the difference plot is expected to indicate positive affect, and a more "negative" value in the difference plot is expected to indicate negative affect
	- The "three subplots" was chosen over the "single plot of the difference" because there are different changes that can cause the same frequency response, and having all three plots makes it easier to see what the changes actually are. Eg. an increase in the right side can look the same as a decrease in the left side
